    <h3 id="the-dagstuhl-publishing-services">The Dagstuhl Publishing Services</h3>

    <p>Dagstuhl Publishing publishes conference proceedings, a journal, and a data journal and consolidates all seminar-related publishing efforts, all in an open access manner. The series can be classified into two groups: (1) service-focused series (OASIcs, LIPIcs, LITES, and DARTS) and (2) seminar-focused series (Dagstuhl Reports, Dagstuhl Manifestos, and Dagstuhl Follow-Ups).</p>
    <p>In the service-focused series, peer-reviewed scientific documents and data (in case of DARTS) from all areas of computer science are published. All publications (and their metadata) also contain person-related data provided by authors and editors about themselves for the purpose of identification, such as names, persistent IDs like ORCIDs, affiliations, email addresses, or hyperlinks to academic websites.</p>
    <p>The seminar-focused series are strongly intertwined with Dagstuhl’s seminar and workshop program and provide a platform to meet the different requirements from this program regarding documentation and dissemination. These publications also contain person-related data such as names, affiliations, and email addresses of participants.</p>
    <p>All bibliographic metadata and documents are published open access, are republished indefinitely and globally accessible on our servers via web pages (<a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/" class="uri">http://drops.dagstuhl.de/</a>, <a href="http://ojs.dagstuhl.de" class="uri">http://ojs.dagstuhl.de</a>), data interfaces (“APIs”), and as download. The metadata is available in various machine-readable data formats. You can view all bibliographic metadata and documents stored about you at any time and in full via our Publication Server (DROPS) and the APIs.</p>
    <p>Since the document and metadata are processed to fulfill our duties as scientific publisher and only to the extent necessary for the scientific reviewing, publication, documentation, and archival within the different Dagstuhl series and periodicals, there is therefore only a possibility of objection if this arises from your particular situation, and if your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh the legitimate information interests of the international research community to access the public metadata and documents. If you feel you are in such a situation, please contact our data protection officer via the e-mail address <a href="publishing-privacy@dagstuhl.de" class="uri">publishing-privacy@dagstuhl.de</a>. (Please do not use this address for non-privacy related requests. For usual publishing inquiries please contact the publishing team via <a href="publishing@dagstuhl.de" class="uri">publishing@dagstuhl.de</a>.)</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you are of course free to contact us at any time for the purpose of withdrawing your scientific publications. With the successful withdrawal or retraction of your publication, we will also remove the publication’s person-related data.</p>
